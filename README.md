# World boundaries in GeoJSON format
This repository contains GeoJSON data for all the countries boundaries including boundaries for states of bigger 
countries (note that this repository is currently filling).
Detalization is good for using this data on scales up to 1:10000000 / gmaps zoom 6-7 (it's the best quality in combination with free-to-use license).
Data is created using http://geojson.io/ tool.
