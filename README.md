# Countries boundaries
This repository contains GeoJSON data for all the countries boundaries including boundaries for states of bigger 
countries (note that this repository is currently filling).
Detalization is good for using this data on scales up to 1:10000000.
Data is created using http://geojson.io/ tool.

## Contribution
As this is a new repository and is filling, contribution would be highly appreciated. 
If you use geojson tool mentioned above, please make sure that you are on a proper scale when creating 
polygons - 20km (better 10km) should be displayed in the bottom-right corner. For smaller countries/states 10km (better 5km) scale is preferrable.
