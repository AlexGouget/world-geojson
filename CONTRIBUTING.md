# Contribution

As this is a new repository and is filling, contribution would be highly appreciated. 

## Scale
If you use geojson tool mentioned in the README, please make sure that you are on a proper scale when creating 
polygons - 20km (better 10km) should be displayed in the bottom-right corner. For smaller countries/states 
10km (better 5km) scale is preferrable.

Ther is no need to be accurate on this scale. It's usually enough to have about 1cm between points, however if border
changes direction drastically, it would be a good idea to put points closer and follow the direction. There are a lot 
of examples in existings files.

## Coast lines
Put 3 to 5 millimeter space between coast line and polygon line in the proposed scale.

## Islands
If an island is visible on the proposed scale, it should be marked around.

## Island groups
Groups of smaller islands located close to one another should be placed into one polygon.
